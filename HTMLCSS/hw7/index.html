        ATTACK OF THE FRONTEND
        When there is no more hope. When Winter is coming. When the White
        Walkers prepare to break down the Wall and JAVA can no longer stop
        them ...
        Comes he - Javascript. Lord of untyped data and components, he does
        not give up technical tasks "to do nicely" and is not afraid of
        calculations on the user side. But he comes not alone, having 3 of
        his
        faithful friends with him: jQuery, React.js and Node.js.
